Title: Music Store Analysis using SQL

                                                        :Introduction:
In this project, I have analyzed a music playlist database using SQL. By examining the dataset and utilizing SQL queries, I have provided insights to the music store, helping them understand their business growth and customer preferences. The analysis involves basic SQL query operations such as joins, group by, having, order by, as well as advanced techniques like window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and recursive functions.

                                                        :Technologies Used:

SQL: Basic query operations including joins, group by, having, order by, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), etc., for data retrieval and manipulation.
MySQL Workbench: Utilized as the database management system for storing and querying the digital music store data.
